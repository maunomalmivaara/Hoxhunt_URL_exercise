    "In this assignment you as a HoxHunt Data Science Hunter are given the task to extract interesting features from a possible malicious indicator of compromise, more specifically in this case from a given potentially malicious URL. \n",

    "This assignment assumes that you are comfortable (or quick to learn) on using Jupyter Notebooks and Python. You are free to use any external libraries you wish. We have included an example below using the Requests library.\n",

    "## Interesting research papers & resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a list of interesting research papers on the topic. They might give you good tips what features you could extract from a given URL:\n",

    "\n",
    "[Know Your Phish: Novel Techniques for Detecting\n",
    "Phishing Sites and their Targets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.06501.pdf)\n",

    "## What we expect\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate potential features you could extract from a given URL, and implement extractors for the ones that interest you the most. The example code below extracts one feature, but does not store it very efficiently (just console logs it). Implement a sensible data structure using some known data structure library to store the features per URL. Choose one feature for which you can visualise the results. What does the visualisation tell you? Also consider how you would approach error handling, if one of the feature extractor fails?\n",
    "\n",
    "Should you make it to the next stage, be prepared to discuss the following topics: what features could indicate the malicousness of a given URL? What goes in to the thinking of the attacker when they are choosing a site for an attack? What inspired your solution and what would you develop next?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we don't expect\n",
    "\n",
    "- That you implement a humangous set of features.\n",
    "- That you implement any kind of actual predicition models that uses the features to give predictions on malicousness at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep it tidy - a human is going to asses your work :)\n",
    "- Ensure your program does not contain any unwanted behaviour\n",
    "- What makes your solution stand out from the crowd?"

    "## #5: Interpretation of Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1: Findings:\n",
    "- As can be seen from the above graph, the MLD lengths of \"safe\" URLs all seem to be around 2-15.\n",
    "- By contrast, the MLDs of phishing URLs tend to be much longer.\n",
    "- The distribution of the phishing URLs has a lower kurtosis than the safe URLs, i.e. the variance of the phishing URL MLD lengths is much larger the one of the safe URLs. As expected, the distribution of the MLD lengths of phishing URLs has a long right tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2: Conclusions:\n",
    "- The MLD lengths of safe URLs tend to be under 20 characters.\n",
    "- The MLD lengths of phishing URLs can range far beyond 20 characters.\n",
    "- Therefore, **a URL with a long MLD can be a signal of a malicious phishing site.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## #6: Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sample size for the safe URLs was very small (n=20) and they were hand-picked. Therefore, the sample cannot be treated as a true representation of the whole population of safe URLs.\n",
    "- It seems that phishing sites reported to phishtank.com tend to be submitted in chunks, which sometimes contain multiple nearly identical URLs. This can skew the results towards certain types of URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## #7 Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- The only feature which takes use of external information is Alexa ranking. If, for some reason, the top 1 million Alexa Rankings couldn't be fetched, the dataframe containing the Alexa Rankings ('alexa_top_million') is returned **empty** and an error is raised.\n",
    "- If errors occur in the extracting of other features, it is due to bugs in code, which have to be assessed manually."
