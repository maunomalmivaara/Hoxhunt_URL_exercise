# Hoxhunt_URL_exercise
This is Mauno Malmivaara's submission for the second coding exercise in the Hoxhunt Data Scientist application.

My solution extracts 9 features from the URLs, as according to the framework by Marchal et al. (2016), and visualises a comparison between the mid level domain (MLD) length distributions of known phishing URLs and safe URLs.
